            <h2>The Four Noble Truths</h2>
            <p>The Four Noble Truths are the foundation of Buddhism, representing Buddha's first teaching after his enlightenment. They provide a framework for understanding suffering and the path to liberation.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>1. The Truth of Suffering (Dukkha)</h3>
                <p>Life inherently contains suffering, dissatisfaction, and impermanence. This includes obvious suffering like illness, aging, and death, as well as subtle forms of dissatisfaction that come from the impermanent nature of all phenomena.</p>
                
                <strong>Three Types of Suffering:</strong>
                <ul style="margin-top: 1rem; padding-left: 2rem;">
                    <li><strong>Dukkha-dukkha:</strong> Obvious suffering (pain, illness, grief)</li>
                    <li><strong>Viparinama-dukkha:</strong> Suffering due to change and impermanence</li>
                    <li><strong>Sankhara-dukkha:</strong> Suffering inherent in all conditioned existence</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>2. The Truth of the Cause of Suffering (Samudaya)</h3>
                <p>Suffering arises from attachment, craving, and ignorance. Our desires and the constant wanting for things to be different than they are creates our suffering.</p>
                
                <strong>Three Roots of Suffering:</strong>
                <ul style="margin-top: 1rem; padding-left: 2rem;">
                    <li><strong>Greed (Lobha):</strong> Attachment and craving</li>
                    <li><strong>Hatred (Dosa):</strong> Aversion and anger</li>
                    <li><strong>Delusion (Moha):</strong> Ignorance of the true nature of reality</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>3. The Truth of the End of Suffering (Nirodha)</h3>
                <p>It is possible to end suffering by eliminating its causes. This state of liberation is called Nirvana - the extinguishing of the fires of greed, hatred, and delusion.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Nirvana represents:</strong> Complete peace, the end of the cycle of rebirth, and ultimate spiritual freedom.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>4. The Truth of the Path (Magga)</h3>
                <p>There is a practical path to end suffering - the Noble Eightfold Path. This is the Middle Way that avoids extremes of indulgence and severe asceticism.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Noble Eightfold Path</h2>
            <p>The Eightfold Path provides practical guidance for ethical conduct, mental discipline, and wisdom. It is traditionally divided into three categories:</p>

            <h3>Wisdom (Prajna)</h3>
            <div class="practice-card">
                <h4>1. Right Understanding (Samma-ditthi)</h4>
                <p>Understanding the Four Noble Truths, the law of karma, and the nature of impermanence. This involves seeing reality as it truly is, not as we wish it to be.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="practice-card">
                <h4>2. Right Intention (Samma-sankappa)</h4>
                <p>Developing wholesome intentions of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness. This means cultivating thoughts free from greed, hatred, and the desire to harm others.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Ethical Conduct (Sila)</h3>
            <div class="practice-card">
                <h4>3. Right Speech (Samma-vaca)</h4>
                <p>Speaking truthfully, avoiding harsh language, gossip, and idle chatter. This includes speaking in ways that promote harmony and understanding.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="practice-card">
                <h4>4. Right Action (Samma-kammanta)</h4>
                <p>Acting ethically by avoiding killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct. This involves living in a way that doesn't harm others or oneself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="practice-card">
                <h4>5. Right Livelihood (Samma-ajiva)</h4>
                <p>Earning a living through honest means that don't harm others. This includes avoiding occupations that involve killing, selling weapons, living beings, meat, alcohol, or poison.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Mental Discipline (Samadhi)</h3>
            <div class="practice-card">
                <h4>6. Right Effort (Samma-vayama)</h4>
                <p>Cultivating wholesome mental states and abandoning unwholesome ones. This involves balanced effort - neither forcing nor being lazy in spiritual practice.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="practice-card">
                <h4>7. Right Mindfulness (Samma-sati)</h4>
                <p>Developing clear awareness of body, feelings, mind, and mental objects. This is the foundation of meditation practice and involves moment-to-moment awareness.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="practice-card">
                <h4>8. Right Concentration (Samma-samadhi)</h4>
                <p>Developing focused, calm, and concentrated states of mind through meditation. This includes the cultivation of the jhanas (absorption states).</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Key Buddhist Concepts</h2>

            <h3>The Three Jewels (Triratna)</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>Buddhists take refuge in the Three Jewels:</p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 2rem;">
                    <li><strong>Buddha:</strong> The enlightened teacher who showed the path</li>
                    <li><strong>Dharma:</strong> The teachings and the truth they reveal</li>
                    <li><strong>Sangha:</strong> The community of practitioners</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>The Three Marks of Existence</h3>
            <div class="practice-card">
                <h4>Impermanence (Anicca)</h4>
                <p>All conditioned things are in constant flux. Nothing remains the same forever.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="practice-card">
                <h4>Suffering (Dukkha)</h4>
                <p>Due to impermanence and our attachments, all conditioned existence contains suffering.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="practice-card">
                <h4>Non-self (Anatta)</h4>
                <p>There is no permanent, unchanging self or soul. What we call "self" is a collection of ever-changing physical and mental processes.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Karma and Rebirth</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Karma</strong> refers to the law of cause and effect in moral actions. Every intentional action has consequences that may manifest in this life or future lives.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Rebirth</strong> is the continuation of consciousness after death, determined by one's karma. The goal is to break free from this cycle through achieving Nirvana.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Applying the Foundations</h2>
            <p>Understanding these foundational teachings is the first step on the Buddhist path. They provide a framework for understanding life and a roadmap for spiritual development. The key is not just intellectual understanding, but practical application through:</p>

            <ul style="padding-left: 2rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
                <li>Regular meditation practice</li>
                <li>Ethical living according to the precepts</li>
                <li>Cultivating wisdom through study and reflection</li>
                <li>Developing compassion for all beings</li>
                <li>Community practice with fellow seekers</li>
            </ul>
